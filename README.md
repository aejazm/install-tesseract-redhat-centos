# install-tesseract-redhat-centos
Script for downloading and installing Tesseract OCR Engine on RedHat and CentOS

This is a Bash script we created to install Tesseract OCR Engine and related dependencies on CentOS 7. I have tested this with CentOS 7.

Due to constantly changing locations of the rpm & leptonica sources, I had to update the installation script.
